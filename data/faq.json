                    "question": "What is ATT&CK?",
                    "answer": "ATT&CK is a knowledge base of cyber adversary behavior and taxonomy for adversarial actions across their lifecycle. ATT&CK has several parts: PRE-ATT&CK, which focuses left of delivery and exploit, ATT&CK for Enterprise, which covers initial access/exploit and beyond, and ATT&CK for Mobile, which focuses on mobile devices.<div class='mt-3'>For more information about the different ATT&CK domains visit:<ul class='mb-0'><li><a href='/resources/enterprise-introduction/' target='_blank'>ATT&CK for Enterprise</a></li><li><a href='/resources/mobile-introduction/' target='_blank'>ATT&CK for Mobile</a></li><li><a href='/resources/pre-introduction/' target='_blank'>PRE-ATT&CK</a></li></ul></div>"

                    "question": "Why did MITRE develop ATT&CK?",
                    "answer": "MITRE started ATT&CK in 2013 to document common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that advanced persistent threats use against Windows enterprise networks. It was created out of a need to document adversary behaviors for use within a MITRE research project called FMX. The objective of FMX was to investigate use of endpoint telemetry data and analytics to improve post-compromise detection of adversaries operating within enterprise networks. ATT&CK was used as the basis for testing the efficacy of the sensors and analytics under FMX and served as the common language both offense and defense could use to improve over time."

                    "question": "What are \"tactics\"?",
                    "answer": "Tactics represent the “why” of an ATT&CK technique. It is the adversary’s tactical objective: the reason for performing an action."
                },
                {
                    "question": "What are \"techniques\"?",
                    "answer": "Techniques represent “how” an adversary achieves a tactical objective by performing an action. For example, and adversary may dump credentials to achieve credential access."

                {
                    "question": "What are \"procedures\"?",
                    "answer": "Procedures are the exact ways a particular adversary or piece of software implements a technique. These are described by the examples sections in ATT&CK techniques."

                    "question": "How can I use ATT&CK?",

                    "question": "Where does the info in ATT&CK come from?",
                    "answer": "Publicly available threat intelligence and incident reporting is the main source of data in ATT&CK. We take what's available in the public and distill out common TTPs. We also use publicly available research on new techniques that closely align with what adversaries commonly do since new TTPs often get used in the wild quickly.
